Welcome to NearField's documentation!
^^^^^^^^

The goal of this project is to develop a complete suite of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) capabilities with a simple and modular design that can be easily reconfigured to meet the requirements of different samples or adapted to other materials analysis techniques.

This document will mainly document the installation and use of the relevant software, as well as the description of project components.
